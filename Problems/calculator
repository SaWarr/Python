# Simple addition calculator - below from memory, line 6ish onwards would be developing this
val_one = float(input("Enter the first value: "))
val_two = float(input("Enter the second value: "))
result = val_one + val_two 
print("Your total is: "+ str(result))

"""
logical next step for this would be to add a choice of operator
could quite easily do this with text input
ie 
oper = input("Please choose one: '+', '-', '/' or '*': ")
if oper == '+':
etc
but will hold off until I know how to loop back and throw an error message to user
